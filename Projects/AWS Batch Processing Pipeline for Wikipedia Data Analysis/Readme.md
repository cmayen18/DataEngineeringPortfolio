## AWS Batch Processing Pipeline for Wikipedia Data Analysis: S3 Storage, EMR Processing, and Athena Querying
## Objectives
The project aims to explore Amazon Web Services (AWS) capabilities for large-scale data analysis using a batch processing approach with Wikipedia data dumps. Key objectives include setting up storage with Amazon S3, processing data using Amazon EMR and PySpark, and querying processed data with Amazon Athena.

## Approach
The project adopts a strategic approach, starting with the creation of an S3 bucket for storing Wikipedia data dumps. It then utilizes Amazon EMR to process the data at scale, leveraging PySpark for tasks such as filtering and aggregation. Finally, it employs Amazon Athena for querying and analyzing the processed data.

## Implementation and Tools
- Set up an AWS account to gain access to AWS services and resources.
- Create an S3 bucket to store the Wikipedia data dumps securely. Configure bucket policies and access control settings as per security requirements.
- Launch an EMR cluster through the AWS Management Console, specifying cluster configurations such as instance types, instance count, and software configurations. Customize the cluster based on workload requirements.
- Upload the PySpark code designed for batch processing onto the EMR cluster. Ensure that the code is compatible with the Spark version installed on the cluster.
- Utilize Amazon S3 as the primary storage solution for storing input data, intermediate data, and output data generated during the processing phase. Organize data within the bucket to maintain data integrity and accessibility.
- Leverage Amazon EMR to process the Wikipedia data dumps at scale. Use PySpark for writing processing logic and defining transformations on the data. Monitor cluster performance and adjust configurations as needed to optimize resource utilization.
- Utilize Amazon Athena to query and analyze the processed data stored in the S3 bucket. Define schemas and tables based on the processed data structure to facilitate efficient querying. Use standard SQL queries to extract insights and perform analysis on the data.
- Interact with AWS services using AWS CLI for command-line operations. Use AWS SDK (specifically 'boto3' in Python) for programmatic interaction with AWS services, enabling automation of tasks and integration with existing workflows.
- Access the EMR cluster securely via SSH to perform administrative tasks and monitor cluster performance. Configure SSH access using EC2 key pairs and ensure secure communication between client and server.
